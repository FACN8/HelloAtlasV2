### The AutoComplete in Searching for Countries and Cities

Our Website enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type. The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of countries and cities, leveraging searching and filtering.
The data file is of type json is used to search through.

In order for our implementation to be fast we only activate the search when the user types.
